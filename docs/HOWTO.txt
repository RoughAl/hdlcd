This file gives some examples how to use the HDLC Daemon
===
Simply start the HDLC daemon (hdlcd / hdlcd.exe) and provide the TCP port number as its first parameter.
The daemon does not require a configuration file and will run until either SIGINT ("CTRL-C") or SIGTERM are received.
The baud rate of the attached device may be 9600 baud or 115200 baud and is auto detected.

Example (GNU/Linux):
---
cd build/src/hdlcd
./hdlcd --port 10000

Example (Microsoft Windows):
---
cd build\src\hdlcd
hdlcd.exe --port 10000

Try creating a symbolic link to hdlcd.exe. This allows to specify the command line parameter and offers
you a very quick possibility to start the HDLC Daemon with one click.
