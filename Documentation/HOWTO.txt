This file gives some examples how to use the provided tools.

1.) The HDLC daemon (HDLCd)
---
Simply start the HDLC daemon (hdlcd / hdlcd.exe) and provide the TCP port number as its first parameter.
The daemon does not requires a configuration file and will run until either SIGINT ("CTRL-C") or SIGTERM are received.
The baud rate of the attached device may be 9600 baud or 115200 baud and is auto detected.

Example (GNU/Linux):

cd build/src/hdlcd
./hdlcd 10000

Example (Microsoft Windows):

cd build\src\hdlcd
hdlcd.exe 10000


2.) The collection of tools to be used together with the HDLCd:
---
Most of these tools require three arguments
- the IP address of the host with the HDLCd entity running,
- the TCP port number of the respective HDLCd entity,
- a device string that indicated which serial port has to be opened.

Example (GNU/Linux):

cd build/src/tools/hdlc-dissector
./hdlc-dissector 127.0.0.1 10000 /dev/ttyUSB0

Example (Microsoft Windows):

cd build\src\tools\hdlc-dissector
hdlc-dissector.exe 127.0.0.1 10000 "\\.\COM1"
