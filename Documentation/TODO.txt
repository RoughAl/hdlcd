Urgent isses:
- HDLC retransmissions (specific to the current limitations of the s-net(r) sensor nodes by Fraunhofer IIS)
- Refactoring of the shared header files:
-> - Requires dedicated access protocol entities for hdlcd and the client side.
   - Modular acceptor / connector logic
   - Propagate direction of arrival flag and the validity flag via access protocol (PARTLY)
   - Implement the final specification of the TCP-based access protocol



Issues to be resolved before a first release:
- All urgent issues have to be resolved
- Add command line switches and online help ("-h --help") to hdlcd
- Logic to suspend / resume serial interfaces via control packets (logic: DONE, via TCP: TODO)
- Rudimentary HDLC protocol is sufficient for the s-net(r) sensor nodes by Fraunhofer IIS
- More tools: pcap-streamer for multiple session types to analyze traffic via wireshark using named pipes (STARTED)
- Better buffer handling to get rid of all remaining memmove and memcpy statements (STARTED)
- Doxygen
- Periodically test idle HDLC links via U-TEST packet; check if the baud rate is still correct, start detection procedure again.
- Communicate the HDLC state (initial and on any change; whether "connected") via control packets
- Communicate the baud rate (initial and on any change) via control packets





Issues to be resolved after the first release:
- Sophisticated HDLC support as specified by the extensive AX.25 documentation at http://www.ax25.net/AX25.2.2-Jul%2098-2.pdf
- New session type to obtain global status information of the HDLC daemon
- New session type to obtain status information regarding a specific serial interface
- New session type for remote logging
- Authentication, maybe?





// DONE
- Implement baud rate detection by probing with TEST frames (DONE)
- Complete specification of the TCP-based access protocol (DONE)
- Tests on recent versions of MS Windows (DONE)
- Fix HDLC send logic, the current send queue implementation is invalid and causes data loss (DONE)
- Send appropriate S-frames (requires send queue) (DONE: RR and SREJ)
- Remove bloated bunch of unnecessary include statements (DONE)
- All tools have to handle direction of arrival flag and the validity flag, i.e., adjust their output messages (DONE)
- Use enums in the ClientHandler to specify the kinds of data to be delivered (DONE)
- Reduce code clones in ClientHandler.cpp (DONE)
- Proper shutdown of the hdlc-hexchanger tool on ioservice shutdown, requires a fix for std::cin.getline() (DONE)
