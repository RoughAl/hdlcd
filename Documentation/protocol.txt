Description of the hdlcd access protocol

1.) Connect a TCP socket to the listener port of the hdlcd (currently 10000)
2.) Send a session header describing the type of data exchange
3.) Send and receive encapsulated packets as well as control packets describing the state of the hdlc protocol

Session header format:
---
The session header must and can only be sent once after initiation of the TCP socket

Length: 0 up to 255 bytes are allowed. However, not all lengths make sense :-)
USB path: file name of the USB port without NULL termination

On any error, the TCP socket is closed immediately without any notification!

Packet header format:
---
Packets can be control packets or data packets

Port status messages
---
There are two types of port status messages: requests and indications

Requests:
---
Port suspend
Port resume
Port restart
Port reset


Indications:
---
